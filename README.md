Data and R files for shoe analysis project

Data collected via google survey. Sent out to "Running Shoe Geeks" Facebook group. 
Had planned to do more analysis and use this for examples in an Intro Stats course. 
As of 11/23/19 I haven't worked on this in several months. Might come back to it at
some point in the future but have decided to go another route for the examples.
